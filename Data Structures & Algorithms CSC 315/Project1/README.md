Algorithm by Raymond Daley (RD) and Ryan Teets (RT)

Source code for the game engine provided by Dr. Paul Hinker

Provided greedyPlayer scores on average 2.8k points

Base change log for Algorithms
    * Attempted simple algorithm of move priorities. LEFT, DOWN, UP, RIGHT. In that order. This algorithm failed to beat the greedyPlayer with an average score of 2.5k points. Method of RT
    * Modified the greedyPlayer to look at the best scores for a given board and work with that board for future moves. This algorithm beats the greedyPlayer with an average score of 5.4k points. Method of RD

Current Veriosn of Algorithm

*The current version of algorithm is based on the minmax game theory that looks
